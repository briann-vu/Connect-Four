# Connect-Four
Description:
Using the pygame module, I created a GUI version of my program in order to display a game of connect four. Two players play on the same mouse and with the same controls. Once a player wins, the game will prompt some text explaining so and shortly after close the program. Before making the GUI, I created a simple text based version of it for the console using a 2D array and 1’s and 2’s to represent the players.

How to play:
Run the program in order for the game window to pop up. Once the game is loaded, red will start. Use the mouse to ‘aim’ at which column you want your piece to land in and left click on your mouse. The second player, yellow, will play on the same mouse and with the same instructions. Line up four pieces in a row in order to win.

What I learned:
	▪	Binding mouse clicks in order to allow for interaction between the user and the game
	▪	How to draw with pygame
